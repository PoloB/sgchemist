"""Definition of engines to communicate with the Shotgrid instance.

The engine is responsible for connecting to the Shotgrid instance and executing
the queries given by the Session object.

The engine ShotgunAPIEngine uses the python shotgun-api3 package.
You can reimplement a new engine using, for example, the REST api by subclassing the
SgEngine abstract class.
